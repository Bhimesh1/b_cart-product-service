# 🧾 Product Service - b\_cart Microservices Architecture

This is the **Product Service** for the `b_cart` microservices-based e-commerce platform. It is built using **Spring Boot**, **Docker**, and **MySQL**, and is one of the core services in the architecture.

---

## 📦 What This Service Does

The Product Service is responsible for:

* Managing the **product catalog**
* Storing and exposing product **details, prices, stock, delivery ETA**
* Tracking **total product views** (used by the Discount Service)
* Exposing REST APIs for CRUD and view tracking

---

## 🧪 REST API Endpoints

### `GET /products`

* Retrieves all products

### `GET /products/{id}`

* Retrieves a specific product by ID

### `POST /products`

* Creates a new product
* Body:

```json
{
  "name": "Apple Watch",
  "price": 299.99,
  "stock": 50,
  "description": "Smart watch with health tracking",
  "deliveryEta": 5
}
```

### `PUT /products/{id}/view`

* Increments the product view counter

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* Java 21
* Spring Boot 3.2
* Spring Data JPA + Hibernate
* MySQL 8
* Docker
* Maven

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup

To build and run the service with Docker:

```bash
mvn clean package

docker build -t bcart/product-service .

docker run -p 8081:8081 bcart/product-service
```

Or use the full setup with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

> Note: The service expects a `productdb` MySQL database with credentials `root/root`.

## 🗃️ Database Schema (Auto-generated by JPA)

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  stock INT,
  description TEXT,
  delivery_eta INT,
  total_views INT DEFAULT 0
);
```
